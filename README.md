# the-grateful-glass

A sample landing page for a non-profit called "The Grateful Glass" using HTML and CSS. The idea is that me and other glass blowers create pieces of art that donate percentages of profits to charities of the buyers choice. 

This is just a sample page not a legitimate business...yet.
